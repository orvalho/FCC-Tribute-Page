        <p id="tribute-info">Persistence refers to perseverance in spite of fatigue or frustration. It's the willingness to keep going even when the odds are bad and our enthusiasm has waned. Persistence is a prime ingredient in success in many pursuits such as athletics, academics, business, etc. Woody Allen once said that 80% of success is just showing up. It is not thinking or feeling but action that really counts.</p>
